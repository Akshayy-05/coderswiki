# Java Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

```bash
int x = 100 + 50;
```


Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

```bash
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
```

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

1.  `Arithmetic operators`
2.  `Assignment operators`
3.  `Comparison operators`
4.  `Logical operators`
5.  `Bitwise operators`


# Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

## Operators:


### 1.  Addition (+)

It adds together two values.

```bash
Example: x + y
```


### 2. Subtraction (-)

It subtracts one value from another.

```bash
Example: x - y
```


### 3. Multiplication (*)

It multiplies two values.

```bash
Example: x * y
```


### 4. Division (/)

It divides one value by another.

```bash
Example: x / y
```


### 5. Modulus (%)

It returns the division remainder.

```bash
Example: x % y
```


### 6. Increment (++)

It increases the value of a vriable by 1

```bash
Example: ++x
```


### 7. Decrement (--)

It decreases the value of a variable by 1

```bash
Example: --x
```


# Java Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

```bash
int x = 10;
```
The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

```
Example:    int x = 10;
            x += 5;
```
